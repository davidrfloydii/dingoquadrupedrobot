Modifications to Dingo Quadruped Robot

## New nose piece
The first modificaiton was to the front of the Dingo robot, it removes the plastic black eye and instead makes room for two HC-SR04 sensors.


## New Fan Housing
This new fan housing creates tabs to act as the hinge. Reduces the number of pieces that need to be ordered.
