Modifications to Dingo Quadruped Robot

## [KiCAD PCB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidrfloydii/dingoquadrupedrobot/main/PCB/)
Since the original files were Altium designer I recreated the board in KiCAD. Not 100% the same since it uses through hole components for the resistors and the diode.

## Modified Base Plate
Instead of ordering the Acrylic pieces you can try to print your own base plates. **Note**: This is not verified to hold up to the stresses of the robot. However if you decide to go this route be sure to use 100% infill for these pieces. Also blue the two halves together. Since it is printed this will have stand offs for 2 of the Raspberry Pi mounts and the rear of the front buck converter.

## Redesigned LCD Bracket
For my build I decided to redesign the rear LCD holder so that screws and nuts weren't positioning. **Note** This still has not been tested and results may vary depending on your printer settings.

## New nose piece
The first modificaiton was to the front of the Dingo robot, it removes the plastic black eye and instead makes room for two HC-SR04 sensors.

## New Fan Housing
This new fan housing creates tabs to act as the hinge. Reduces the number of pieces that need to be ordered.
