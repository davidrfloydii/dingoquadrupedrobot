Modifications to Dingo Quadruped Robot

## KiCAD PCB
Since the original files were Altium designer I recreated the board in KiCAD. Not 100% the same since it uses through hole components for the resistors and the diode.

## New nose piece
The first modificaiton was to the front of the Dingo robot, it removes the plastic black eye and instead makes room for two HC-SR04 sensors.

## New Fan Housing
This new fan housing creates tabs to act as the hinge. Reduces the number of pieces that need to be ordered.
